Case file 11 – Gillian (Low Risk)  

Gillian and Kyle were in a de facto relationship for 6years. Kyle suffers from substance abuse issues including prescription drugs and alcohol which exacerbates and escalates his abuse towards Gillian. Behaviour is described as psychotic and terrifying. However despite a history of physical, emotional and financial abuse, Gillian and Kyle have now been separated for 6 years and she possesses sole custody of their children. While a protection order has been put in place, Kyle still tries to contact her. It does not appear that Gillian life is in imminent danger or that there is certainty the abuse will escalate. Therefore, the best course of action would be to provide Gillian with support agencies that can help her move forward emotionally and  financially.  

Case file 12- Hilary (Moderate Risk) 

There has been a history of family and domestic violence from Hillarys ex-partner, Bruce. He has a history of not only physically assaulting Hillary, but also verbally assaulting Hillarys children and asserting power and control over them. Despite several attempts to seek protection from Police and the Courts, Bruce still has access to the shed which is located on Hilary’s property. When he comes by he often verbally abuses her, she feels unsafe in her home and has changed her locks several times. It would be in her best interest to get further legal advice or representation to seek a permanent restraining order to prevent Bruce from entering her property or going near her and her children.  

Case file 13- Ingrid (High Risk) 

Ingrid’s partner Scott has a history of physical, sexual, financial and emotional abuse. He was a heavy user of marijuana and other prescription drugs due to work-place injuries and PTSD, which not only kept him from working but also made his abusive tendencies much worse. He has a violent, aggressive and threatening nature that has caused Ingrid and her child a great deal of emotional stress. While matters have been taken to the Courts, Ingrid’s evidence of her abuse was often overlooked or minimised, therefore there is not adequate protection for her in the eyes of the law. Ingrid’s movements and quality of life is still being greatly affected and reduced by Scott as she is too scared to return to her hometown.   

Case file 14- Jane (Low Risk) 

Jane has experienced years of economic, emotional and psychological abuse from her ex-husband Richard. Throughout their marriage Richard has been the primary earner and provider for the family, and he would use this to justify following, harassing and monitoring Jane’s movements and spending. When Richard was angry he would damage property, verbally abuse Jane and involve their children. While this case clearly reflects several types of abusive and controlling behaviours, Jane and Richard are separated, she now has her own job and it has not been stated whether there has been any contact between the two, therefore the risk level is quite low. Jane would benefit mainly from being put into contact with agencies that can provide her with psychological and financial support.  

Case file  - Jennifer (High/Imminent Risk) 

Jennifer’s ex-partner Frank exhibits clear signs of abusive, controlling, narcissistic behaviour which has led to ongoing physical, verbal, emotional and financial abuse. Both are elderly (over the age of 60). Frank had Jennifer move to a rural and remote community where his business is set up and she cannot afford to move out of this area. He has not only abused her but has also killed her dog. Despite Police and Court intervention, she has been told that there is nothing more they can do to protect her legally. She fears for her life and future and he continues to intimidate her from her neighbours fence line. While she has installed her home with cameras, locks and lights, it is clear Franks abusive behaviour is not stopping and he has successfully contested a protection order. Therefore Jennifer has no protection from the law and is in imminent danger of experiencing further/escalating abuse from Frank.
